Indexing implementations
========================

There are two indexing implementations included:

ImmediateIndexer
================

This is the default indexer. As soon as a model instance is saved or deleted, 
the post_save signal will update the index. 

This is useful when your documents are small or easily computable and indexing
won't hold up your web process too much. It's also handy in development so you
don't have to mess around with cron jobs to do your indexing.

If your search documents require a lot of computing to index, you should
consider using a delayed indexer such as the DBQueuedIndexer, so your web 
process doesn't have to wait for indexing.

DBQueuedIndexer
===============

The DBQueuedIndexer uses a database model to store a queue of documents to
index. It's up to you to add a cron job or other process to actually index the
documents.

To switch to using the DBQueuedIndexer, add to your settings.py::
    
    SEARCH_INDEXER = "solango.indexing.DBQueuedIndexer"

Run syncdb to make create the queue table::
    
    python manage.py syncdb

Your cron job can call the management command to index the queued documents::
    
    python manage.py solr --index-queued

This will first index the documents, and then remove them from the queue.

Custom Implementations
======================

You can define your own indexers. You'll probably want to extend 
`solango.indexing.BaseIndexer` or one of the above indexers.
If you make something clever, let us know, so we can include it in Solango!
